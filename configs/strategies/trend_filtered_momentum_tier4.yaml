  EXP-002: Trend-filtered momentum strategy.

  Hypothesis: Using SPY > MA200 as a trend filter reduces catastrophic losses
  by switching to defensive assets during bear markets.

  Bullish regime (SPY > MA200): Use 12-month momentum to select top 5 ETFs
  Bearish regime (SPY < MA200): Allocate to defensive assets (AGG, TLT, GLD, USMV, SPLV)

  Expected: Avoid 2018 (-19.3%) and 2022 (-24.5%) drawdowns while capturing
  bull market gains.
