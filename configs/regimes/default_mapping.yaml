# Default Regime to Strategy Mapping
# See: handoffs/architecture/ADR-001-regime-based-strategy-selection.md
#
# This is the INITIAL mapping based on financial intuition.
# The optimizer will generate an empirical mapping that supersedes this.
# This file serves as a fallback and documentation of expected behavior.

# Default mapping (hypothesis - to be validated empirically)
mapping:
  uptrend_low_vol: "momentum_acceleration"
  # Rationale: Clean trends favor momentum with acceleration detection

  uptrend_high_vol: "vol_adjusted_momentum"
  # Rationale: Trends exist but noisy, vol-adjustment helps

  downtrend_low_vol: "momentum"
  # Rationale: Shorter lookback for faster signals in declining market

  downtrend_high_vol: "vol_adjusted_momentum"
  # Rationale: Capital preservation focus, reduce exposure via vol adjustment

# Fallback when regime detection fails or data is missing
# This should be the most robust strategy from optimization
fallback: "momentum_acceleration"

# Notes for optimizer
# When generating empirical mapping, save to:
#   artifacts/optimization/{timestamp}/regime_mapping.yaml
# The production system loads the latest optimization mapping,
# falling back to this file if none exists.
