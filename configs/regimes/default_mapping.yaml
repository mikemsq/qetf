# Default Regime to Strategy Mapping
# See: handoffs/architecture/ADR-001-regime-based-strategy-selection.md
#
# This is the INITIAL mapping based on financial intuition.
# The optimizer will generate an empirical mapping that supersedes this.
# This file serves as a fallback and documentation of expected behavior.

# Default mapping (hypothesis - to be validated empirically)
mapping:
  uptrend_low_vol:
    strategy: "momentum_acceleration"
    rationale: "Clean trends favor momentum with acceleration detection"
    config_path: "configs/strategies/momentum_acceleration_top5.yaml"

  uptrend_high_vol:
    strategy: "vol_adjusted_momentum"
    rationale: "Trends exist but noisy, vol-adjustment helps"
    config_path: "configs/strategies/vol_adjusted_momentum_top5.yaml"

  downtrend_low_vol:
    strategy: "momentum"
    rationale: "Shorter lookback for faster signals in declining market"
    config_path: "configs/strategies/momentum_accel_1m_3m_tier1.yaml"

  downtrend_high_vol:
    strategy: "vol_adjusted_momentum"
    rationale: "Capital preservation focus, reduce exposure via vol adjustment"
    config_path: "configs/strategies/vol_adjusted_momentum_top5.yaml"

# Fallback when regime detection fails or data is missing
fallback:
  strategy: "momentum_acceleration"
  rationale: "Best overall performer from optimization"
  config_path: "configs/strategies/momentum_acceleration_top5.yaml"
