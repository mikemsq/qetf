# Example Regime-Based Alpha Selector Configuration
#
# In a regime-based selector, each market regime maps to a single alpha model.
# This is useful for simple, interpretable selection rules where you want a
# different model to lead in different market conditions.

type: regime_based

# Default model to use if regime is not in the mapping below.
# This is a safety net for unmapped regimes.
default_model: momentum

# Regime-to-model mapping: each regime maps to exactly one model name.
# Model names must correspond to models registered in the AlphaModelRegistry.
regime_mapping:
  # RISK_ON: Use aggressive momentum when markets are trending up
  risk_on: momentum_acceleration
  
  # ELEVATED_VOL: Switch to vol-adjusted momentum in transition periods
  elevated_vol: vol_adjusted_momentum
  
  # HIGH_VOL: Use conservative dual-momentum in high volatility
  high_vol: dual_momentum
  
  # RECESSION_WARNING: Conservative diversified approach
  recession_warning: momentum
  
  # TRENDING: Accelerate gains in trending markets
  trending: momentum_acceleration
  
  # MEAN_REVERTING: Use mean reversion signals
  mean_reverting: momentum
  
  # UNKNOWN: Fall back to base momentum
  # (optional, can omit and default_model will be used)
  unknown: momentum

# Notes:
# - Regime names must match MarketRegime enum values exactly
# - Model names must be registered in your AlphaModelRegistry
# - If a regime is detected but not in this mapping, default_model is used
# - This creates simple, understandable switching logic that's easy to audit
