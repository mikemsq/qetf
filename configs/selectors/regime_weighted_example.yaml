# Example Regime-Weighted Alpha Selector Configuration
#
# In a regime-weighted selector, each market regime specifies weights for
# a blend of alpha models. This allows creating dynamic ensembles that adapt
# to market conditions while maintaining exposure to multiple signals.

type: regime_weighted

# Default weights to use if regime is not in the mapping below.
# These weights will be normalized to sum to 1.0.
default_weights:
  momentum: 0.7
  momentum_acceleration: 0.3

# Regime-specific weight configurations.
# For each regime, specify the models and their relative weights.
# Weights don't need to sum to 1.0 - they'll be normalized automatically.
regime_mapping:
  # RISK_ON: Favor acceleration in uptrends
  risk_on:
    momentum: 0.5
    momentum_acceleration: 0.5
  
  # ELEVATED_VOL: Add vol-adjustment
  elevated_vol:
    momentum: 0.4
    vol_adjusted_momentum: 0.6
  
  # HIGH_VOL: Shift to conservative vol-adjusted approach
  high_vol:
    vol_adjusted_momentum: 0.7
    dual_momentum: 0.3
  
  # RECESSION_WARNING: Diversify across multiple approaches
  recession_warning:
    momentum: 0.33
    vol_adjusted_momentum: 0.33
    dual_momentum: 0.34
  
  # TRENDING: Concentrate on momentum in trends
  trending:
    momentum: 0.4
    momentum_acceleration: 0.6
  
  # MEAN_REVERTING: Revert-focused blend
  mean_reverting:
    momentum: 0.5
    momentum_acceleration: 0.5

# Notes:
# - Regime names must match MarketRegime enum values exactly
# - Model names must be registered in your AlphaModelRegistry
# - Weights are normalized automatically (don't need to sum to 1.0)
# - If a regime is detected but not in this mapping, default_weights is used
# - Zero weights are allowed (effectively removing a model from that regime)
# - This creates adaptive ensembles that balance multiple signals per regime
