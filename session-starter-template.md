## Usage Tips

### For iPhone Sessions:

- **Use the top sections** - optimized for mobile
- **Keep it short** - iPhone is for quick iterations
- **Focus on one thing** - planning, reviewing, or light coding
- **Save longer work** for desktop sessions

### For Desktop Sessions:

- **Load full context** - all three main files
- **Deeper work** - complex features, refactoring, testing
- **Multiple parallel tabs** - work on different features
- **Detailed documentation** - comprehensive session notes

### Session Type Guide:

- **Morning (iPhone):** Planning, review yesterday’s work
- **Midday (iPhone):** Quick check-ins, code reviews
- **Afternoon (Desktop):** Implementation, testing, deep work
- **Evening (iPhone):** Update logs, prepare handoffs

-----

## Pro Tips for iPhone

1. **Create iOS Shortcut** to paste session starter
1. **Bookmark URLs** in Safari for quick access
1. **Use Siri** to open Claude app + paste from clipboard
1. **Keep sessions focused** - one goal per mobile session
1. **Switch to desktop** for code generation or complex debugging

-----

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (5 min - iPhone):

1. Open Claude app
1. Paste “iPhone Quick Start” template
1. Fill in today’s goal
1. Review context summary
1. Get started

### During Day (iPhone + Desktop):

- **iPhone:** Check progress, light reviews, planning
- **Desktop:** Heavy implementation, testing, debugging
- Rotate between 2-3 desktop tabs for parallel work

### Evening Routine (10 min - iPhone):

1. Review all sessions’ output
1. Update PROGRESS_LOG.md via GitHub Mobile
1. Create session note via GitHub Mobile
1. Set tomorrow’s priorities
