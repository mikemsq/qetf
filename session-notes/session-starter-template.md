## Version 1: Full Context Load (Desktop Sessions)

```
I'm working on QuantETF. Please read these files to load project context:

2. Current progress:

Once you've read both files, let me know you're ready and summarize:

Then I'll give you today's specific task.

**Pro Tips:**

- Desktop sessions: Use Version 1 (Full Context) for thorough work
- Always include CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md and PROGRESS_LOG.md URLs
- For continuing work, link to the previous session note

-----

## Mobile Quick Access

**Bookmark these URLs on mobile:**

- CLAUDE_CONTEXT: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikemsq/qetf/main/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
- PROGRESS_LOG: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikemsq/qetf/main/PROGRESS_LOG.md
